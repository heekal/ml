## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Machine Learning-based Classification**  
  Uses a trained base **Random Forest** model to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **normal**, based on behavioral features.

- 📊 **User-friendly Web Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit for an interactive and easy-to-use experience.

- 📈 **Probability Score Output**  
  Provides a probability score that indicates the likelihood of a transaction being malicious.

- 🔍 **Efficient & Lightweight**  
  Streamlit-powered front end that is sufficient for analyzing behavior without the need for heavy infrastructure.
